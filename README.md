## Configuration

Configuration could be defined in `.prometheus-rds-exporter.yaml` or environment variables (format `PROMETHEUS_RDS_EXPORTER_<PARAMETER_NAME>`).

| Parameter | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| aws-assume-role-arn | AWS IAM ARN role to assume to fetch metrics | |
| aws-assume-role-session | AWS assume role session name | prometheus-rds-exporter |
| debug | Enable debug mode | |
| listen-address | Address to listen on for web interface | :9043 |
| log-format | Log format (`text` or `json`) | text |
| metrics-path | Path under which to expose metrics | /metrics |

Configuration parameters priorities:

1. `$HOME/.prometheus-rds-exporter.yaml` file
2. `.prometheus-rds-exporter.yaml` file
3. Environment variables
4. Command line flags

### AWS authentication

Prometheus RDS exporter needs read only AWS IAM permissions to fetch metrics from AWS RDS, CloudWatch, EC2 and ServiceQuota AWS APIs.

Standard AWS authentication methods (AWS credentials, SSO and assume role), see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-envvars.html.

If you are running on [AWS EKS](), we strongly recommend to use [IRSA](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/iam-roles-for-service-accounts.html)

Minimal required IAM permissions:

```yaml
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "AllowFetchingRDSMetrics",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "cloudwatch:GetMetricData",
                "ec2:DescribeInstanceTypes",
                "rds:DescribeAccountAttributes",
                "rds:DescribeDBInstances",
                "rds:DescribeDBLogFiles",
                "rds:DescribePendingMaintenanceActions",
                "servicequotas:GetServiceQuota"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Installation

### Locally

1. Connect on AWS with any method

    ```bash
    aws configure
    ```

2. Start application

    ```bash
    prometheus-rds-exporter
    ```

### Docker

1. Connect on AWS with any method

2. Start application

    ```bash
    docker run -p 9043:9043 -e AWS_PROFILE=${AWS_PROFILE} -v $HOME/.aws:/app/.aws public.ecr.aws/g1r8z6f4/prometheus-rds-exporter:latest
    ```

### EKS (using IRSA and Helm)

1. Create an IAM policy

    ```bash
    IAM_POLICY_NAME=prometheus-rds-exporter
    aws iam create-policy --policy-name ${IAM_POLICY_NAME} --policy-document file://configs/aws/policy.json
    ```

2. Create IAM role and EKS service account

    ```bash
    IAM_ROLE_NAME=prometheus-rds-exporter
    EKS_CLUSTER_NAME=default # Replace with your EKS cluster name
    KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE=default # Replace with the namespace that you want to use
    KUBERNETES_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME=prometheus-rds-exporter
    AWS_ACCOUNT_ID=$(aws sts get-caller-identity --query "Account" --output text) # Replace with your AWS ACCOUNT ID
    eksctl create iamserviceaccount --cluster ${EKS_CLUSTER_NAME} --namespace ${KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE} --name ${KUBERNETES_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME} --role-name ${IAM_ROLE_NAME} --attach-policy-arn arn:aws:iam::${AWS_ACCOUNT_ID}:policy/${IAM_POLICY_NAME} --approve
    ```

3. Deploy chart with service account annotation

    ```bash
    helm install prometheus-rds-exporter oci://public.ecr.aws/g1r8z6f4/prometheus-rds-exporter-chart --namespace ${KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE} --set serviceAccount.annotations."eks\.amazonaws\.com\/role-arn"="arn:aws:iam::${AWS_ACCOUNT_ID}:role/${IAM_ROLE_NAME}"
    ```

### Terraform

You can take example on Terraform code in `configs/terraform/`.

## Alternative

[percona/rds_exporter](https://github.com/percona/rds_exporter) and [mtanda/rds_enhanced_monitoring_exporter](https://github.com/mtanda/rds_enhanced_monitoring_exporter) provides are great alternatives.

[prometheus/cloudwatch_exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/cloudwatch_exporter) could be used to collect additional CloudWatch metrics.

## Contribute

See CONTRIBUTING.md

## Development

### Running the tests

Execute golang tests:

```bash
make test
```

Execute Helm chart tests:

```bash
make helm-test # Helm unit test
make kubeconform # Kubernetes manifest validation
```

### Development environment

You can start a simple development environment using the Docker compose configuration in `/scripts/prometheus`.

It will start and configure Grafana, Prometheus, and the RDS exporter:

1. Connect on AWS using the AWS CLI

1. Launch development stack

    ```bash
    cd scripts/prometheus
    docker compose up --build
    ```

1. Connect on the services

    - Grafana: http://localhost:3000 (credential: admin/hackme)
    - Prometheus: http://localhost:9090
    - Prometheus RDS exporter: http://localhost:9043
